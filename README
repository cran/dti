2008/3/10: changes from version 0.4-0 to 0.5-0

- new method for tensor estimation 
  method=="regularized"  uses the parametrization from Koay et.al. (2006)

- alternative statistical penalty based on difference of log-likelihood values 
  (this will be the only available method for method=="nonlinear" and method=="regularized"
  since it eliminates the need to distinguish between covariance matrices for D and rho)


2008/3/26: regularized tensor estimation should work now
speed up for dtidata
hopefully problems solved for regularized smoothing, still needs testing

2008/3/31: new version of dti-package
now includes method="regularized" to require positive definite tensors
values for lambda \approx 20-25 for (method="regularized" or method="nonlinear")

2008/4/1: removed all (almost) unused code 
new version 0.5-1

2008/4/2: version 0.5-2
changed class definitions

2008/4/3: plot has new argument view, bugfixes
recognize orientation of data
general voxel extensions

2008/4/4: some fixes
dtiData, dtiTensor, dtiIndices and nonlinear smoothing works 

2008/4/10: some fixes
now with generic plot routines for classes dtiData and dtiTensor 
changed class dtiIndices

2008/4/11: added generic functions print, summary
extended generic function plot for classes dtiData and dtiTensor

2008/4/21: bugfix in smoothing routines !!! incorrect normalization in location penalty
new code for determining bandwidths for anisotropic smoothing 

2008/4/22: aws (nonlinear) now uses constant sum of location weights for all anisotropic neighborhoods in one iteration step
plot has additional arguments xind,yind,zind

2008/5/15: Added demo: our simulated data example
creates the phantom, noisy data, and smoothes it. This it can reproduce figure 2 from Neuroimage 39(4), 1763-1773 (2008)

2008/5/16: demo finished

2008/5/19: bugfix fortran code (infinite loop was possible in step size control)
fixes in demo
added some additional things in demo
revised man pages to avoid warnings

2008/5/19: new version number 0.5-3
first trial to release to CRAN 

2008/5/20: new version number 0.5-4 
with depends: methods and corresponding docu

2008/5/21: demo now uses tmpfile() for temp files
medinria2tensor braucht extract.data()

2008/7/24: version 0.5-5
forced masks to be connective
